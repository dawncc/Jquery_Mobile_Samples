				<p>UW Tacoma and YMCA announce partnership for new development
January 16, 2013
UW Tacoma and the YMCA of Pierce and Kitsap Counties are collaborating to build a full-service Y located on the UW Tacoma campus.  It will serve UW Tacoma students, faculty and staff, as well as all Y members. This innovative partnership is built on the common commitment of both institutions to serve community.

“This collaboration will create a tremendous resource for both our students and the Y with a building and set of programs that jointly provide so much more than either institution could offer on its own,” says UW Tacoma Chancellor Debra Friedman. “We are proud of this innovative collaboration, which will serve as a best-practice model for urban-serving universities like UW Tacoma.”

“The Y looks forward to offering health and well-being services to UW Tacoma students, and expanding offerings to Y members and the community,” says the Y’s President and CEO Bob Ecklund. “Healthier students contribute to an overall healthier community.”

Tacoma and the Y are exploring a 55,000- to 70,000-square-foot facility at South 17th Street and Market Street in downtown Tacoma. Students will benefit from the Y’s expertise in offering health and wellness programs. The project is in a preliminary stage of development but the expected amenities could include cardio and weight rooms, group exercise rooms, a gymnasium, locker rooms, and a child watch area. In addition, students will determine how to utilize spaces dedicated for student assembly, student government, and other student activities.

The facility will be open to all UW Tacoma students, faculty, and staff, to current Y members, and will enhance Y offerings to its growing downtown membership.  One of the special features of this arrangement, especially important to UW Tacoma students, the majority of whom live throughout the South Sound, is that they C like all members of the Y C will have access to any of the seven YMCA healthy living facilities throughout Pierce and Kitsap Counties.

“This is also a tangible example of two Tacoma-based organizations working together to build the social and economic capacity of our city,” says Ecklund.</p>
